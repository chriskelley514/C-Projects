C Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of C programming projects demonstrating fundamental concepts, algorithms, and practical applications in the C language.

Contents:
- Multiple standalone C programs covering topics such as data structures, algorithms, file I/O, and more.
- Each project includes source code files and, where applicable, input/output examples.

Purpose:
These projects serve as hands-on practice to strengthen programming skills in C and showcase understanding of key computer science principles.

How to Use:
- Download the C_Projects.zip file and extract it locally.
- Open the extracted folders to explore individual projects.
- Compile and run the C source files using a C compiler (e.g., gcc):
  gcc project_name.c -o project_name
  ./project_name
- Review the source code for implementation details.

Technologies:
- C programming language
- Standard C libraries
